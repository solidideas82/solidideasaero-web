# Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

This document serves as a step-by-step guide for deploying the solidideasaero-web project to GitHub Pages.

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to the repository on GitHub: [solidideas82/solidideasaero-web](https://github.com/solidideas82/solidideasaero-web)
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section on the left sidebar.
4. Under **Source**, select **main branch** from the dropdown.
5. Click **Save** to enable GitHub Pages.


## Step 2: Configure Custom Domain (if needed)
1. In the **Pages** section of the repository settings, look for the **Custom domain** field.
2. Enter your custom domain (if you have one) and click **Save**.
3. Make sure to update your DNS records based on the information provided by GitHub.


## Step 3: Test the Live Site
- After enabling GitHub Pages, your site should be available at:
  - **https://solidideas82.github.io/solidideasaero-web/**
- Access the link above in your browser to ensure the website is live and functioning as expected.


## Notes
- It may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your site to become live after enabling GitHub Pages.
- If using a custom domain, ensure your domain's DNS settings are correctly configured and pointing to GitHub Pages.

Happy deploying!
